# Methods

small RNA-seq counts were generated by [bcbio][] and [bcbioSmallRna][] using [seqbuster][] and [seqcluster][]. Counts were imported into [R][] using [isomiRs][] and [DESeq2]. Plots were generated by [ggplot2][]. Heatmaps were generated by [complexHeatmap][].

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
